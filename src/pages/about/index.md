title: Hi, I'm Anna.
---
I'm a **creative technologist** with a background in photography, filmmaking and post production. I study Creative Technologies at Film University Babelsberg near Berlin, Germany. Prior to that, I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Audiovisual Media at Stuttgart Media University, with a semester abroad at the Northern Film School in Leeds. Besides studying, I regularly work as a freelance set manager for ZDF Sport.

I am interested in various facets of creative technologies, including creative coding, mixed reality, volumetric video, tool development, interactive installations, and physical computing.

Aside from that, I work and experiment with analog and digital photography. Generally, I'm passionate about technology, design, and our environment.

Check out my projects to see what I previously worked on.
